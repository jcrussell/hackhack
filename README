hackhack
========

Utilities that mess with hack's memory to give the user an advantage.


Usage
-----

sudo full_health.py [PID]

The utility attaches to the process specified by PID or the first ``hack''
process it finds using python-ptrace. It then updates the user's health to full
health. Currently, the locations of the user's health and full health are
hard-coded based on addresses found in GDB. Eventually, it would be nice to
scan memory to find the correct addresses automatically.


Dependencies
------------

python-ptrace
python-psutil
